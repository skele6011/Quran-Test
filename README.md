[Access it here](https://skele6011.github.io/quranic-light/quranic-light-intro.html)

## About
This web application provides a comprehensive platform for testing and improving Qur'an memorization skills.  Designed for learners of all levels, it offers a variety of features to enhance the memorization process and track progress.

## Features:
* Memorization test: Test your knowledge of verses from the Quran. You pick a surah, then the generator will provide you with a verse, and you read the verse and continue after, then check your answer to see if you're correct.

## What's the future looking like?
I am are planning to expand this application by adding more features such as:

* A better UI that will make it easier for users to navigate through the application.
* A tracker that will allow users to see their progress over time and identify areas where they need improvement.
* A feature that will allow users to share their progress with others, either by sending them a link or by sharing their results on social media.
* A juz feature as multiple surah is a bit difficult to use.

## How can I contribute?
I'm a solo student programmer, I'm very bad at this (ðŸ˜…). I am looking for contributors who can help me improve the application.  If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me @ [my email](abdelrahmanebed@gmail.com)
